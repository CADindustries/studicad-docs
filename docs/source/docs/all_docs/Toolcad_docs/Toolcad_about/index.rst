Toolcad
======================================

**Toolcad v22** is a very useful app for WorldSkills Shanghai and other similar competitions.    

It can be downloaded `here <https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1MULGcDXXeqL1SJ7KRQgblY_s85TBMcss?usp=sharing>`__.   

Of course there could be viruses, but I don't know how to make them. But next time make sure what you are downloading from the internet.
