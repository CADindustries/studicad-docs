Getting started
=========

Where to begin?  

First you need to download robocadSim and run it. `Latest version. <https://github.com/CADindustries/robocadSim/tree/robocadSim_v1.3>`__  

I hope you have already chosen the language with which you will program your robot and the IDE for it.   

You can read how to start using libraries for the selected language `here. <https://robocadsim.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docs/all_docs/lib_docs/index.html>`__  

Write a program, turn on the robot and run the code!
