Getting started
=======================

Where to begin?  

First you need to have VMX and Titan with **firmwarecad** software. If you are not from Russia or Estonia you can lick my ass and then maybe I will give this firmwares to you.

Then you should choose IDE where you will write your programs - **NetBeans** or **IntelliJ**.  

You can read how to start using **picad4j** libraries for the selected IDE.

Write a program, turn on the robot and run the code using **shufflecad**!
